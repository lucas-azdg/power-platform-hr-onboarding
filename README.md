# HR Onboarding Automation – Power Platform

## Overview
This project presents the design of an HR onboarding automation built with Microsoft Power Platform.

The solution automates the employee onboarding process, including data collection, approval workflow, status tracking, and notifications.

## Business Scenario
When HR submits a new onboarding request:
1. Employee data is collected via Microsoft Forms
2. The request is stored in an Excel-based data source
3. A manager approval workflow is triggered
4. The request status is updated (Approved / Rejected)
5. Automated email notifications are sent

## Flow Design
Due to tenant restrictions, this repository documents the **full functional design** of the Power Automate flow, ready for deployment in a production environment.
